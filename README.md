# chattree
##The awesomest branching chat app ever made

We decrease the number of notifications in a group chat by allowing users to respond and receive messages for only the messages and topics they are interested in. Users will create a new chat window by clicking on a message, at which point a new chat window will appear to continue the conversation. Users who are not interested in the conversation will not receive any notifications for that specfic chat branch.

## Additional features we would like to implement include:
* Chat functionality with sockets
* Visualization to show users which chat branch they are currently in 
* If a message is starting to gain lots of attention, spawn a new banner to notify all users that a topic is catching on fire. Maybe measure it with messages per minute.
* Testing, front end/ back end


## Technology Stack
* React 
* PostgreSQL

##tl;dr
Check out how we structured our database to see how we wanted the app to function. Feel free to structure the front end how you want.
